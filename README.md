## Localyze coding challenge
#### To run the code, you need to install Node.js if you don't have it:
```brew install node```

#### and run the following for each Challenge:
```node Challenge{number}.js```

*This will work for all challenges except `Challenge4.js` - it's a React.js pseudocode and will give errors if run with node.
